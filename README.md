1 -  Ruby on Rails to convert a static page you need to adapt it to ruby by doing
some conversion to your static page. we used this link a lot to help us out at first
https://tatyanacodes.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/static-website-to-ruby-on-rails-web-application/
We build some partials which are in charge of loading the footers and headers for all pages

2 - Linux terminal for windows where all the magic happens this week. Within this terminal is where you will enable your rails server like so
- type in the terminal : rails server (keep in mind for this to work you should have Ubuntu, rails, ruby, mysql and postgresql installed)

3 - installing mysql on ubuntu  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04

4 - for creating tables in mysql with mondels
- rails g model tableName
- once the table created you need to upload them through migration
- rails db:drop
- rails db:create
- rails db:migrate
- rails db:seed ( used to populate your database if needed)

- devise was mainly used for the signin, signup and log in
- rails-admin for the admin section the whole back office

# Week 5


During this week, participants are exposed to a more elaborate data model and must perform basic query exercises. They will be asked to create tables, alter them and extend the concepts managed by their information system.
Two types of databases will be requested for this exercise
A relational database
A data warehouse for decision-making

1. create a link to the postgresql database
2. tables added in mysql
- address
- leads
- customers
- buildings
- building_details
- batteries
- columns
- elevators
![](app/assets/images/readme/week5_mysql_diagram.png)

3. postgresql is going to be our data warehouse for decision-making



- to connect to your postgresql DB you nees to start it with this command line: 
**sudo service postgresql start/stop/status**


![](app/assets/images/readme/postgresql.png)

4.  also to  create and migrate tables its very similar to mysql except you add  DB=nameOfDatabase: 

- **DB=dwh rails db:create**
- **DB=dwh rails db:migrate**

5. the tables created for postgres
- FactQuotes
- FactContact
- FactElevator
- DimCustomers

![](app/assets/images/readme/week5_postgresql_diagram.png)

6. updated Admin section with charts and new tables mysql and postgresql
![](app/assets/images/readme/wk5updadmin.png)
7. Rake tasks

  Rake tasks are custom build executable files that we are using to populate the postgresql database (Dwh) from our seeded data and submit data from web pages (quotes and contact us forms). Within theses task we establish a connection to our mysql DB and postgres DB, 
  
 

      (actual data to  connect is in the rake file not the read me)
This is an example of a rake task

  ``` Ruby
  desc "Import data from Quote Table to Fact Quote Table"
  task quotes: :environment do
    dwh = PG::Connection.new(host: 'localhost', port: port, dbname: "dbname", user: "user", password: "password")
    puts "lead table to fact_quote table"
    
    dwh.exec("TRUNCATE fact_quotes")

    dwh.prepare('to_fact_quotes', 'INSERT INTO fact_quotes (quote_id, creation, company_name, email, nb_elevator, created_at, updated_at) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)')
    Quote.all.each do |quotes|
      dwh.exec_prepared('to_fact_quotes', [quotes.id, quotes.created_at, quotes.quotes_company_name, quotes.quotes_email, quotes.elevator_amount])
    end
  end 
  ```

8. File attachement in the contact us form was also added and supports all types of files. the filename can be seen in the admin section of the leads table and in the database.

9. Charts were added in the admin panel through chartskick
10. updated routes week 5
